# Cursor Rules

## Commit Messages

- Always use conventional commit format when creating commits
- Format: `<type>(<scope>): <subject>`
- Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
- Examples:
  - `feat: add new command for listing notes`
  - `fix: resolve issue with note parsing`
  - `docs: update README with usage examples`
  - `refactor: simplify note storage logic`

## Code Formatting

- Always run prettier after generating or modifying code
- Use the project's format script: `npm run format`
- Ensure all code follows the project's prettier configuration before committing
